## Installation

To use `bond_form_getx`, simply add it as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  bond_form_getx: ^0.0.1
```

## Usage:

### Import the package

```dart
import 'package:bond_form_getx/bond_form_getx.dart';
```

### Create a Form Controller

Extend the `GetxFormController` to create your form controller:

```dart
import 'package:get/get.dart';
import 'package:bond_form/bond_form.dart';
import 'package:bond_form_getx/bond_form_getx.dart';

class LoginFormController extends GetxFormController<String, Error> {
  @override
  Map<String, FormFieldState> fields() => {
    'email': TextFieldState(
      null,
      label: 'Email',
      rules: [Rules.required()],
    ),
    'password': TextFieldState(
      null,
      label: 'Password',
      rules: [Rules.required()],
    ),
  };

  @override
  Future<String> onSubmit() async {
    final email = state.required().textFieldValue('email');
    final password = state.required().textFieldValue('password');
    // simulate login
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
    return 'Welcome $email';
  }
}
```

### Use the Form Controller in a Widget

```dart
final controller = Get.put(LoginFormController());

Obx(() {
  final state = controller.formState.value;
  return Column(
    children: [
      TextField(
        onChanged: (value) => controller.updateField('email', value),
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          labelText: 'Email',
          errorText: state.fields['email']?.error,
        ),
      ),
      const SizedBox(height: 16),
      TextField(
        onChanged: (value) => controller.updateField('password', value),
        decoration: InputDecoration(
          labelText: 'Password',
          errorText: state.fields['password']?.error,
        ),
        obscureText: true,
      ),
      const SizedBox(height: 24),
      ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: () => controller.submit(),
        child: const Text('Login'),
      ),
    ],
  );
})
```

## Core Components:

### `GetxFormController`

An abstract class that helps you manage your form state, providing essential functionalities for form validation and submission. It extends the Getx's `GetxController` class and mixes in `FormController` for added capabilities. The state is represented as an instance of `BondFormState`, which encapsulates all the form fields and their statuses.

Example:

```dart
class MyFormController extends GetxFormController<String, MyError> {
  // Implement required methods...
}
```
