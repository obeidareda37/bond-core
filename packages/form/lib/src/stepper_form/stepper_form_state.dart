/// A state class representing a form with multiple steps.
///
/// The `StepperFormState` class extends [BaseBondFormState] to manage the state
/// of a form divided into multiple steps. It provides functionality to handle
/// and combine the state of individual form steps into a single state representation.
///
/// Type Parameters:
///   - [Success]: The data type representing a successful form submission result.
///   - [Failure]: The error type that extends [Error] representing the failure cases of form submission.

  ///
  /// This factory constructor initializes a [StepperFormState] with the given [parent] controller
  /// and a list of [steps], combining the form fields and statuses from each step into a single state.
  ///
  /// The [parent] controller is assigned to each step, ensuring proper coordination between
  /// the step controllers and the parent stepper controller.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [parent]: The [StepperFormController] that manages the entire multi-step form process.
  /// - [steps]: A list of [StepFormController] instances representing the individual steps in the form.
  ///
  /// Returns:
  /// A new instance of [StepperFormState] with all combined fields, statuses, and an initial step index of 0.
  ///
  /// The returned state has:
  /// - [currentStep] Set to 0, indicating the starting step of the form.
  /// - [fields] Combined form fields from all the steps.
  /// - [status] The combined status derived from all the step states.
  /// - [success] Set to `null` initially (to be determined by the form submission).
  /// - [failure] Set to `null` initially (to be determined by the form submission).
